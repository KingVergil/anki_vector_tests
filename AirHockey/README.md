# AirHockey.py

Example script to have Vector find a puck, travel down rink,
and score!

Uses OpenCV to find the puck, along with many of Vector's
behaviors and SDK functions.

Vector's cube is placed on top of the goal.

An earlier version of code was used for this video:

Please note:  There are a bunch of parameters specific to the 
air hockey puck and table I was working with.  You'll most
likely need to make changes...
